One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

This project is a website made for fans of the Harry Potter series. Users of the website are able to interact with the websites through the use of gamification concepts. Users are able to participate in various quizzes that will test their knowledge of the series. There are also quizzes that asks questions that are personality based and determine which house (faction) that they would belong in, if they were to live in the world of Harry Potter. This website can also serve as a wiki for fans to find out more information about the lore of the fictional world.

DESIGN PROCESS Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. The website is primarily made for fans of the Harry Potter series and also for people who are curious about fantasy stories. Since Harry Potter is a massive franchise that captivates the imagination and passion of many people, fans and enthusiasts usually wonder how their life would be like if they were to live in a world of wizards, magic and fantasical creatures. Users of the websites are able to take short questionaires that asks personality questions and relate them to the world. For example, a house in Harry Potter is like a faction in the school of Hogwarts and each of them are associated with different traits. So when users take the house quiz, it determines which house they would beloing to. Once the user finds out which house they belong to and the different traits they represent, they will feel a sense of identity and relation towards the Harry Potter universe. In turn, they will also be immersed in the website. Other than the house quiz, there is also wand quiz which finds out which type of wand the person would use and the patronus quiz which is discovers what 'spirit animal' the user would have.
